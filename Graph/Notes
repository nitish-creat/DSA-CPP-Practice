BFS AND DFS (GRAPH TRAVERSAL)

BFS -->
IT IS A GRAPH TRAVERSAL ALGO THAT EXPLORE 
VERTICES LEVEL BY LEVEL STARTINF FROM A GIVEN 
SOURCE VERTICES
IT USES QUEUE DATA STRUCTURES 
1. CHOOSE A STARTING VERTEX
2. CREATE A VISTED ARRAY OR SET MARK ALL VISITED
3. CREATE AN EMPTY QUEUE
4. MARK THE SORUCE VERTEX AS VISITED
5. N QUEUE(INSERT) 
6. TRAVERSING STEPS -->   
    WHILE QUEUE IS NOT EMPTY DEQUEUE THE ELEMENT 
    PROCESS 
    FOR EACH ADJACENT VERTEX V OR U 
        IF V IS NOT VISITED MARK V AS VISITED AND ENQUEUE IT

ba
    BFS(GRAPH,SOURCE):
        CREATE VISITED[]
        CREATE QUEUE Q
        VISITED[SOURCE]=TRUE
        ENQUEUE (Q,SOURCE)
        WHILE Q IS NOT EMPTY:
            U=DEQUEUE(Q);
            PRINT U
            FOR EACH V IN ADJACENT(U)
                IF(VISITED[V]==FALSE)
                    VISITED[V]=TRUE
                    ENQUEUE(Q,V)


DFS
1. FIND THE SHORTEST PART IN UNWAITED PATHS
2. SPACE COMPEXITY IS EQUAL TO O(V);



Dijkstra’s Algorithm

TO FIND THE SHORTEST DISTANCE FROM ALL THE NODES

STEPS :=>
    1. MARK ALL NODES AS UNVISITED
    2. DISTANCE OF SOURCE IS 0
    3. DISTANCE OF ALL OTHER NODES ARE INFINITY
    4. A PICK A GREEDY NODE (LESS DISTANCE NODE)
    5. FROM ALL UNVISITED NODES PICK A NODE WIHT SMALLEST DISTANCE
    6. NEIGHBOURS :-
        1. FOR THE SELECTED NODES U CHECK ALL ITS NEIGHBOURS V
        2. UPDATE DISTANCE IF A SHORTEST PATH IS FOUND
        3. NEW DISTANCE OF U + WEIGHT(U,V)
        4. MARK NODE U AS VISITED AND THE SHORTEST DISTANCE IS PICKED FOR YOU 
        5. REPEAT STEPS 2 TO 4 UNTIL 


DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING IS AN OPTIMIZE TECHINQUE
WHICH FINDS ALL THE POSSIBLE SOULTIONS AND CHOOSE ONE OF THE MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM BASED ON REQUIRMENT
DIJKSTRA ALGO CAN'T WORK ON NEGATIVE INDICES(WEIGHTS)
THAT'S WHY WE MOVE TO BALMAFALD ALGO 

STESP: 
1. INTILIZE THE SOURCE VERTX DISTANCE AS 0;
2. THE REMAINING ALL THE NODE DISTANCE AS INFINTY 
3. LIST OUT ALL THE ADJACENT'S , HERE WE CAN START FROM ANY EDGE TO FIND THE DISTANCE 
4. IN THIS ALGO RELAXES THE ADJACENT'S (N-1 TIMES) N= NO. OF VERTICES
5. TO FIND THE DISTANCE OD DESTINATION(IF DISTANCE OF U + CONST (U,V) < 2 IS THE DISTANCE OF V )
6. DISTANCE OF V IS (U,V)
